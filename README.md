# Internet Sharing Script

This script enables internet sharing from one network interface (e.g., connected to the internet or VPN) to another (e.g., a Wi-Fi access point). It dynamically configures IP forwarding, sets up `iptables` rules for NAT, configures `dnsmasq` for DHCP services, and generates a `hostapd` configuration file to create a Wi-Fi access point. The script allows optional configuration for a DNS server, automatically unblocks the Wi-Fi interface if it is blocked, and checks if the Wi-Fi interface is connected to any other network prior to setup. It uses `nmcli` (from `NetworkManager`) to manage and ensure Wi-Fi disconnection and reverts the interface to its previous state once internet sharing is disabled.

## Requirements

- `dnsmasq`: Used to provide DHCP services.
- `hostapd`: Used to create a Wi-Fi access point.
- `iptables`: For configuring NAT (Network Address Translation) rules.
- `rfkill`: Used to unblock the Wi-Fi interface if needed.
- `NetworkManager` (`nmcli`): Manages Wi-Fi connections and restores the Wi-Fi interface to its original state when sharing is disabled.

## Installation

Ensure `dnsmasq`, `hostapd`, `rfkill`, and `NetworkManager` are installed on your system:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install dnsmasq hostapd rfkill network-manager
```

## Usage

```bash
./nic_sharing.sh <on|off> <source_interface> <destination_interface> --ssid <SSID> --pass <PASSWORD> [--dns <DNS_SERVER>]
```

- `<on|off>`: Enables or disables internet sharing.
- `<source_interface>`: Network interface connected to the internet or VPN (e.g., `eth0`, `wg0`, or `tun0`).
- `<destination_interface>`: Network interface to act as the access point (e.g., `wlan0`).
- `--ssid <SSID>`: The SSID name for the Wi-Fi access point.
- `--pass <PASSWORD>`: The password for the Wi-Fi access point.
- `--dns <DNS_SERVER>`: (Optional) Sets a custom DNS server (e.g., for an Active Directory DNS) for clients connecting to the Wi-Fi access point.

### Example Commands

#### Enabling Internet Sharing

To enable internet sharing from the source interface `eth0` to Wi-Fi interface `wlan0` with a custom SSID, password, and DNS server:
```bash
./nic_sharing.sh on eth0 wlan0 --ssid "MyAccessPoint" --pass "MySecurePassword" --dns 192.168.x.x
```

#### Disabling Internet Sharing

To disable internet sharing and revert configurations:
```bash
./nic_sharing.sh off eth0 wlan0
```

## Features

- **Automatic DHCP and Gateway Configuration**: Configures `dnsmasq` to provide DHCP services on the specified Wi-Fi interface with a predefined IP range.
- **Custom DNS Option**: Allows specifying a custom DNS server with the `--dns` option, such as a DNS server in an Active Directory environment.
- **Dynamic Wi-Fi Configuration**: Generates a temporary `hostapd.conf` file based on specified SSID and password. This file is deleted upon deactivation.
- **Wi-Fi Interface Unblocking**: Checks if the Wi-Fi interface is blocked and unblocks it if necessary.
- **Automatic Disconnection Check and Restoration**: If the Wi-Fi interface is connected to a network before activation, the script uses `nmcli` to disconnect it. Upon deactivation, the interfaceâ€™s previous state is restored, reconnecting it if it was connected previously.
- **Reverts to Original State**: When disabled, all configurations, including IP forwarding, iptables rules, and DHCP settings, are restored to their original state.

## How It Works

1. **Enabling Sharing (`on`)**:
   - Ensures the Wi-Fi interface is disconnected from any active networks.
   - Enables IP forwarding.
   - Configures NAT for internet sharing through iptables.
   - Configures `dnsmasq` to provide DHCP and (optionally) a custom DNS server.
   - Generates an `hostapd.conf` file with the specified SSID and password, and starts `hostapd` to create a Wi-Fi access point.

2. **Disabling Sharing (`off`)**:
   - Disables IP forwarding.
   - Removes NAT and iptables rules.
   - Restores the original `dnsmasq` configuration.
   - Stops `hostapd` and deletes the generated `hostapd.conf` file.
   - Restores the Wi-Fi interface to its previous connection state using `nmcli`.

### Important Notes

- **Wi-Fi Interface Management**: If the Wi-Fi interface is blocked by `rfkill`, the script will automatically unblock it. The script also uses `nmcli` to disconnect any active Wi-Fi connections before setting up the access point and reconnects it when sharing is disabled, if it was connected beforehand.
- **Permissions**: Ensure to run the script with `sudo` to apply system-wide network configurations.
- **File Restoration**: The script automatically backs up the original `dnsmasq.conf` and restores it upon disabling, ensuring the system returns to its prior state.

### Example Output

When enabling sharing:
```plaintext
Activating Internet sharing from eth0 to wlan0...
IP forwarding enabled.
NAT MASQUERADE rule added for eth0.
FORWARD rule for RELATED,ESTABLISHED added.
FORWARD rule for outgoing traffic added.
Wi-Fi interface wlp0s20f3 configured with IP 192.168.60.1.
Creating hostapd configuration for SSID 'MyAccessPoint'...
hostapd configuration created with SSID 'MyAccessPoint'.
hostapd started with SSID 'MyAccessPoint'.
dnsmasq restarted.
Internet sharing enabled.
```

When disabling sharing:
```plaintext
Deactivating Internet sharing...
IP forwarding disabled.
NAT MASQUERADE rule removed for eth0.
FORWARD rule for RELATED,ESTABLISHED removed.
FORWARD rule for outgoing traffic removed.
Wi-Fi interface wlan0 down.
hostapd stopped and configuration removed.
Restoring Wi-Fi interface wlan0 to previous connection state...
dnsmasq restarted.
Internet sharing disabled.
```

## Troubleshooting

If the Wi-Fi access point is not visible or cannot connect to the internet:
- Ensure the Wi-Fi adapter supports AP mode and is not blocked by hardware or software.
- Confirm that `hostapd`, `dnsmasq`, and `iptables` are installed and configured correctly.
- Check `hostapd` and `dnsmasq` logs for any errors with:
  ```bash
  sudo journalctl -u hostapd
  sudo journalctl -u dnsmasq
  ```
- Use `nmcli device status` to ensure that the Wi-Fi interface is managed by NetworkManager.
